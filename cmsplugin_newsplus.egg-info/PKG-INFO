Description: News plugin for django-cms 3.0b3
        ===============================
        
        This plugin provides a simple news feature for django-cms 3.0b3 and newer.
        
        It is based off of a fork of cmsplugin-news located here:
        https://bitbucket.org/zerok/cmsplugin-news
        
        The goal of newsplus is to provide the simplicity of cmsplugin-news while
        added some additional functionality, such as images.
